### A Minecraft Plugin to Automatic Turning on and Shutting Down Servers.

## WHY?
So basically I'm starting up my old MC server for a weekend jus for fun and for the memories but it finna be a limited time event.
This plugin is to put some cool bar at the top to countdown to the shutdown to stress everyone out hopefully :pray:. should look pretty cool

## This plugin is for my own personal use and will be archived after I shut the server down again.
Hopefully we can improve upon curfew from last year. Re-read ts today and it is Terrible!
